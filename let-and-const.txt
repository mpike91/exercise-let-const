ES2015 Global Constants:
const PI = 3.14;
PI = 42;

QUIZ:
1) "var" declares a function-scoped variable. "let" declares a block-scoped variable. Thus "var" can be redeclared and reassigned,
but "let" cannot be redeclared - only reassigned.
2) "var" is function-scoped, and "const" is block-scoped. "var" can be redeclared or reassigned. "const" cannot be redeclared
or reassigned.
3) "let" and "const" are both block-scoped variable initializers. "let" variables can be reassigned but not redeclared. "const"
variables cannot be reassigned or redeclared.
4) "Hoisting" is the JS compiling behavior for "var" variables, where the declarations are "performed" first before other code.
Thus they will be declared, but not initalized or modified until later code does so.
